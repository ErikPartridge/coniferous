Decision trees and random forests for Rust

This is an exceedingly experimental package. Please do not use it for any sort of usage that requires stability until version 0.5.

I will release at the following steps, each hopefully being vaguely stable once it is released.

0.2 = CART
0.3 = ID3
0.4 = RandomForest
0.5 = Stabilized all three
